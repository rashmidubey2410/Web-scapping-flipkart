5Mind-blowing purchase,"It is a brilliant phone for the price. 3 GB memory handles most of the tasks thrown at it. It can handle most games like Asphalt etc.The audio output is good, but Dolby Atmos, when activated, just adds another dimension to the output through headsets. There are no headsets in the package, so it would be good to invest in a good headset like Senheiser or SkullCandy if you really are passionate about music. (You can buy a Bose, but why you'd buy this phone if you could afford a Bose is beyond...READ MORE",Navin Quadros,/reviews/0176f6e0-23be-4100-9d7f-f9629bf93406

4Four Stars,"Decent ProductI purchased this phone for 7499 and I won't suggest anyone to buy it for 8499 as u can go for redmi 4 3GB variant (8999) or redmi 4A variants ,if u are able to get them in flash sales I chose this phone over redmi 4 as I had a budget of less than 8000 and this was and is the best option available in this price.After 3weeks of heavy usage like recording 1080p videos,Playing high end games like modern combat 5 ,WWE 2K ,Dead trigger 2 ,Asphalt 8 ,WWE immortals NOVA etc.I am givin...READ MORE",Utkarsh Sharma,/reviews/9c1b503e-4dd2-4548-8d7f-02976add8bb9
